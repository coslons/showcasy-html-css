## 🚀 About the Project

This project is a front-end coding challenge I gave myself to improve my skills in:

* **HTML structure & semantics**
* **Responsive CSS layouts**
* **Modern UI styling**
* **Typography and visual hierarchy**

I recreated the UI from a static design (see above) with the goal of making it **as accurate and clean as possible**, without using JavaScript or front-end frameworks.
